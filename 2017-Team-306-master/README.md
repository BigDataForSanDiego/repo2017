## Public Health Question:
***How can Californians maintain a daily health regimen?***

## Hackathon Idea in Two Sentences:

This app will show the benefits of walking or biking to a location instead of driving. It would visualize how many calories would be burned by walking/biking and also show the amount of money that would be saved by not consuming gas.

## Datasets/APIs

We will utilize the Google Maps JavaScript API's Directions service in order to find the proper walking and biking routes.
