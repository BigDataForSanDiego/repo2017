U.S. HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY SURVEY MODULE: 

THREE-STAGE DESIGN, WITH SCREENERS 

Economic Research Service, USDA 

September 2012 

 

Revision Notes: The food security questions are essentially unchanged from those in the original 
module first implemented in 1995 and described previously in this document. 

September 2012: 

. Corrected skip specifications in AD5 
. Added coding specifications for “How many days” for 30-day version of AD1a and 
AD5a. 


July 2008: 

. Wording of resource constraint in AD2 was corrected to, “…because there wasn’t 
enough money for food” to be consistent with the intention of the September 2006 
revision. 
. Corrected errors in “Coding Responses” Section 


September 2006: 

. Minor changes were introduced to standardize wording of the resource constraint in most 
questions to read, “…because there wasn't enough money for food.” 
. Question order was changed to group the child-referenced questions following the 
household- and adult-referenced questions. The Committee on National Statistics panel 
that reviewed the food security measurement methods in 2004-06 recommended this 
change to reduce cognitive burden on respondents. Conforming changes in screening 
specifications were also made. NOTE: Question numbers were revised to reflect the new 
question order. 
. Follow up questions to the food sufficiency question (HH1) that were included in earlier 
versions of the module have been omitted. 
. User notes following the questionnaire have been revised to be consistent with current 
practice and with new labels for ranges of food security and food insecurity introduced by 
USDA in 2006. 


 

Transition into Module (administered to all households): 

These next questions are about the food eaten in your household in the last 12 months, since 
(current month) of last year and whether you were able to afford the food you need. 

 

 

Optional USDA Food Sufficiency Question/Screener: Question HH1 (This question is 
optional. It is not used to calculate any of the food security scales. It may be used in 
conjunction with income as a preliminary screener to reduce respondent burden for high 
income households). 

 

HH1. [IF ONE PERSON IN HOUSEHOLD, USE "I" IN PARENTHETICALS, OTHERWISE, 
USE "WE."] 


 

 Which of these statements best describes the food eaten in your household in the last 12 
months: —enough of the kinds of food (I/we) want to eat; —enough, but not always the 
kinds of food (I/we) want; —sometimes not enough to eat; or, —often not enough to eat? 

 

 [1] Enough of the kinds of food we want to eat 

 [2] Enough but not always the kinds of food we want 

 [3] Sometimes not enough to eat 

 [4] Often not enough to eat 

 [ ] DK or Refused 


Household Stage 1: Questions HH2-HH4 (asked of all households; begin scale items). 

 

[IF SINGLE ADULT IN HOUSEHOLD, USE "I," "MY," AND “YOU” IN 

PARENTHETICALS; OTHERWISE, USE "WE," "OUR," AND "YOUR HOUSEHOLD."] 

 

HH2. Now I’m going to read you several statements that people have made about their food 
situation. For these statements, please tell me whether the statement was often true, 
sometimes true, or never true for (you/your household) in the last 12 months—that is, 
since last (name of current month). 

 

The first statement is “(I/We) worried whether (my/our) food would run out before (I/we) 
got money to buy more.” Was that often true, sometimes true, or never true for (you/your 
household) in the last 12 months? 

 

 [ ] Often true 

 [ ] Sometimes true 

 [ ] Never true 

 [ ] DK or Refused 

 

HH3. “The food that (I/we) bought just didn’t last, and (I/we) didn’t have money to get more.” 
Was that often, sometimes, or never true for (you/your household) in the last 12 months? 

 

 [ ] Often true 

 [ ] Sometimes true 

 [ ] Never true 

 [ ] DK or Refused

User Notes 

 

(1) Coding Responses and Assessing Household Food Security Status: 

Following is a brief overview of how to code responses and assess household food security status 
based on various standard scales. For detailed information on these procedures, refer to the 
Guide to Measuring Household Food Security, Revised 2000, and Measuring Children’s Food 
Security in U.S. Households, 1995-1999. Both publications are available through the ERS Food 
Security in the United States Briefing Room. 

 

Responses of “yes,” “often,” “sometimes,” “almost every month,” and “some months but not 
every month” are coded as affirmative. The sum of affirmative responses to a specified set of 
items is referred to as the household’s raw score on the scale comprising those items. 

 

. Questions HH2 through CH7 comprise the U.S. Household Food Security Scale (questions 
HH2 through AD5a for households with no child present). Specification of food security 
status depends on raw score and whether there are children in the household (i.e., whether 
responses to child-referenced questions are included in the raw score). 
o For households with one or more children: 
. Raw score zero—High food security 
. Raw score 1-2—Marginal food security 
. Raw score 3-7—Low food security 
. Raw score 8-18—Very low food security 


o For households with no child present: 
. Raw score zero—High food security 
. Raw score 1-2—Marginal food security 
. Raw score 3-5—Low food security 
. Raw score 6-10—Very low food security 






 

Households with high or marginal food security are classified as food secure. Those with 
low or very low food security are classified as food insecure. 

 

. Questions HH2 through AD5a comprise the U.S. Adult Food Security Scale. 
. Raw score zero—High food security among adults 
. Raw score 1-2—Marginal food security among adults 
. Raw score 3-5—Low food security among adults 
. Raw score 6-10—Very low food security among adults 







 

. Questions HH3 through AD3 comprise the six-item Short Module from which the Six-Item 
Food Security Scale can be calculated. 
. Raw score 0-1—High or marginal food security (raw score 1 may be 
considered marginal food security, but a large proportion of households that 
would be measured as having marginal food security using the household or 
adult scale will have raw score zero on the six-item scale) 
. Raw score 2-4—Low food security 
. Raw score 5-6—Very low food security 






 

. Questions CH1 through CH7 comprise the U.S. Children’s Food Security Scale. 
. Raw score 0-1—High or marginal food security among children (raw score 1 
may be considered marginal food security, but it is not certain that all 
households with raw score zero have high food security among children 
because the scale does not include an assessment of the anxiety component of 
food insecurity) 
. Raw score 2-4—Low food security among children 
. Raw score 5-8—Very low food security among children 






 

(2) Response Options: For interviewer-administered surveys, DK (“don’t know”) and 
“Refused” are blind responses—that is, they are not presented as response options, but marked if 
volunteered. For self-administered surveys, “don’t know” is presented as a response option. 

 

(3) Screening: The two levels of screening for adult-referenced questions and one level for 
child-referenced questions are provided for surveys in which it is considered important to reduce 
respondent burden. In pilot surveys intended to validate the module in a new cultural, linguistic, 
or survey context, screening should be avoided if possible and all questions should be 
administered to all respondents. 

 

To further reduce burden for higher income respondents, a preliminary screener may be 
constructed using question HH1 along with a household income measure. Households with 
income above twice the poverty threshold, AND who respond <1> to question HH1 may be 
skipped to the end of the module and classified as food secure. Use of this preliminary screener 
reduces total burden in a survey with many higher-income households, and the cost, in terms of 
accuracy in identifying food-insecure households, is not great. However, research has shown that 
a small proportion of the higher income households screened out by this procedure will register 
food insecurity if administered the full module. If question HH1 is not needed for research 
purposes, a preferred strategy is to omit HH1 and administer Adult Stage 1 of the module to all 
households and Child Stage 1 of the module to all households with children. 

 


(4) 30-Day Reference Period: The questionnaire items may be modified to a 30-day reference 
period by changing the “last 12-month” references to “last 30 days.” In this case, items AD1a, 
AD5a, and CH5a must be changed to read as follows: 

 

AD1a/AD5a/CH5a [IF YES ABOVE, ASK] In the last 30 days, how many days did this 
happen? 

 

 ______ days 

 

 [ ] DK 

 

Responses of 3 days or more are coded as “affirmative” responses.
